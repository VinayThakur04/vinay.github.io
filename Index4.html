                <p>Solar energy is the transformation of energy present in the sun. The majority of sunlight
                    that enters the earth’s atmosphere comes in the form of visible light and infrared
                    radiation. Plants utilize it to turn it into sugar and starches, a process known as
                    photosynthesis. Solar energy can be converted into usable energy, and there are many
                    ways of doing it to get heat, electricity, hot water, and even cooling buildings and
                    industrial complexes. Solar panels are equipment that can absorb the Sun’s rays and
                    generate heat or electricity with it. The most common types of solar panels fit into
                    three broad categories; monocrystalline, thin-film, and polycrystalline. These solar
                    panels are different from each other in the way they are made, the cost involved in
                    making them, their performances, appearance, and the kind of installation they are best
                    suited for. Each of these panels has unique features and capabilities.

                Solar energy is considered to be environmentally friendly because it is a renewable
                energy source that does not produce harmful emissions or pollutants. Unlike fossil
                fuels, which release greenhouse gases and other pollutants when burned to generate
                electricity, solar energy systems produce clean electricity from the sun’s rays.
                This means that using solar energy can help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and
                decrease our carbon footprint. <br>
                In addition, solar energy systems can be installed on rooftops or in other unused spaces,
                which means they do not require the clearing of large areas of land like some other forms
                of energy production. This can help preserve natural habitats and reduce the impact of energy
                production on the environment.

                A solar power calculator is a tool that can help you estimate the amount of solar
                power that can be generated by a solar panel system. These calculators typically take
                into account factors such as the power of the solar panels, the number of panels in
                the system, the average number of sunlight hours per day, and the efficiency of the system.<br>
                Using a solar power calculator can help you determine whether a solar panel system is a good investment
                for your home or business. By providing an estimate of the amount of solar power that can be generated
                by the system, a solar power calculator can help you calculate the potential savings on your electricity
                bill and determine how long it will take for the system to pay for itself.
